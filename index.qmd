# Part 0: Setup

Notice that we expect participants with different levels of experience in this tutorial. Furthermore, the tutorial duration is only 3 hours and thus quite short. As a consequence, this material often links to other resources with more detailed information instead of blowing up the content of this material. However, where possible, these links don't simply lead to official online documentation etc. which may be hard to grasp for beginners, but instead to other workshop content created by this tutorial's main lecturer.

The decision on which plots to create in this workshop was inspired by [this blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/15_alternative_paired_bars/15_alternative_paired_bars.html) by [Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/) whose R and data visualization content is worth checking out!

}
```

# Part 1: A single plot

Let us first create a single plot to compare the life expectancy between 1952 and 2007 for seven countries, respectively. 

## data prep

The data is courtesy of [the Gapminder foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/) and can easily be accessed via the [{gapminder}](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/) package. We can then make use of [the pipe operator `%>%`](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#the-pipe-operator) to create a subset of the data via the [`filter()` function](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#filter). Then, in order for our ggplot to work as intended in the next step, we also need to format the year column as a factor instead of an integer value via [`mutate()`](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#mutate). Both functions are from the [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package which we loaded as part of the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Finally, we use `droplevels()` to get rid of the factor levels that are now no longer present in the data (i.e. the countries we did not filter for).

```{r}
dat <- gapminder::gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952 | year == 2007) %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "Germany", "Japan", "Netherlands", "Nigeria", "Vietnam", "Zimbabwe")) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) %>% 
  droplevels()

dat
```

## base plot

One typical way you may find data like this visualized is via a grouped bar plot. The minimum amount of code to create such a plot via ggplot is this:

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = year) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

[Read this](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/summaryarticles/ggplot2intro.html#lets-start) if you are not familiar with the general ggplot syntax. We need to add `position = position_dodge()` to `geom_col()`, since the default is to stack the multiple bars (for the different years) on top of each other (as seen in the *Nature* example plot below).

### (factor) level reordering

It may seem irritating that countries are sorted alphabetically starting at the bottom. Moreover, 1952 is below 2007 in the plot (but not in the legend!). This is because these two columns are formatted as factors in our data and by default factor levels are sorted alphabetically.

Note that ggplot applies this factor level order, but does it so from bottom to top.

```{r}
levels(dat$country)
```

A useful package for dealing with factors in R is [{forcats}](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) whose functions all start with `fct_*`. One way of dealing with this is changing the factor level order in the data before passing it to ggplot. Here, we may simply reverse the order via `fct_rev()`.

```{r}
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(across(c(country), ~ fct_rev(.x)))
```

```{r}
levels(dat$country)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = year) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Alternative 1
#| eval: false
# alternatively, you may apply fct_rev() inside aes() instead of altering the data beforehand 
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = fct_rev(country), fill = year) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Alternative 2
#| eval: false
# alternatively, you may manually provide the levels in the desired order within scale_y_discrete()
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = year) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = c("Zimbabwe", "Vietnam", "Nigeria", "Netherlands", "Japan", "Germany", "Canada"))
```

However, it probably makes more sense to sort the countries according to the data. Here, we could sort them according to their life expectancy in 2007.

```{r}
sorted_countries <- dat %>% 
  filter(year == "2007") %>% 
  arrange(lifeExp) %>% 
  pull(country) %>% 
  as.character()

dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_relevel(country, sorted_countries))

ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = year) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

Next, we address the order of years in the plot and the legend. As you can see in the previous plots, once more the first factor level (1952) is on the bottom, while the second level (2007) is on top. Thus, we could use one of the approaches shown for `country` to change that. More precisely, let's take the approach of *Alternative 1* and use `fct_rev()` inside the `aes()`. 

Note however, that while this changes the order of the years in the plot, it does not affect their order in the legend. To address that, we can use the `limits =` argument in `scale_fill_manual()` (which corresponds to *Alternative 2* above):

```{r}
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = fct_rev(year)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_discrete(limits = c("1952", "2007"))
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Alternative
#| eval: false
# alternatively, you may reverse the legend order via guides()
ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = fct_rev(year)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
```

## reproducing a theme

Now that we've got the basics correct, the next thing I would want to change is things like the theme, i.e. the non-data components of the plot: titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends. 

Using `theme()` allows us to format our plot in any way we want. Instead of picking things based on what feels good, let us here try to recreate the layout of a plot published in [*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03305-w) in '150 years of Nature: a data graphic charts our evolution' by Richard Monastersky & Richard Van Noorden (2019). [URL to the  plot](https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-019-03305-w/d41586-019-03305-w_17345518.png).

![](https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-019-03305-w/d41586-019-03305-w_17345518.png)

Thus, a better starting point would be to use the [complete theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) `theme_minimal()` instead of the default `theme_gray()`. From here, we can further adjust things via `theme()`.

Furthermore, let's also pick two of the colors used in that image (e.g. via any [online color picker](https://google.gprivate.com/search.php?search?q=pick+color+from+image+online)) for our years. We can create a named vector `year_colors` and when changing `scale_fill_discrete()` to `scale_fill_manual()` supply it via the `values =` argument.

Finally, as our ggplot-code is getting longer, let's start saving out current plot into an object `p` and reuse it.

```{r}
year_colors <- c("1952" = "#F7AA59", "2007" = "#37A9E1")

p <- ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = fct_rev(year)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Year",
    limits = names(year_colors), 
    values = year_colors) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

p
```

### font

To further replicate the aesthetics of the Nature plot, we introduce a custom font named *Kanit*. This font, available through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), has been chosen for its stylistic resemblance to the one used in the Nature publication. 

The process begins by fetching the font from Google Fonts and making it available for use in our R session via `sysfonts::font_add_google("Kanit", "kanit")`. Next, `showtext::showtext_auto()` activates the use of custom fonts in plots. It's important to also run `showtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)` to avoid getting unexpected results. This is because `{showtext}` uses a default of 72 dpi, while e.g. exporting plots via `ggsave()` defaults to `dpi = 300`. Furthermore, you may also want the dpi to be 300 (or some other number) when rendering plots within your RMarkdown via `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dpi = 300)` or quarto document via `fig-dpi: 300`.

We add a title and subtitle via `labs()` and then apply the font to all text elements via `text = element_text(family = "kanit")`. For some reason, the default position of title and subtitle in a ggplot is left-aligned with the y-axis - to instead left-align it with the left side of the entire plot, we apply `plot.title.position = "plot"`. Making the title a bit bigger and bold is straightforward. However, having a subtitle (or other text elements) that has automatic line breaks when the string is too long actually requires `{ggtext}` and more specifically a `ggtext::element_textbox_simple()` instead of the default `ggplot2::element_text()`. 

```{r}
sysfonts::font_add_google("Kanit", "kanit")
showtext::showtext_auto()
# We already did this above, but dont forget about it:
# showtext::showtext_opts(dpi = 300)

long_subtitle <- "In the mid-twentieth century, global life expectancy was shaped by post-war recovery, with variations across countries. As decades progressed, public health advances and socioeconomic growth painted a new picture of longevity. The data now reflect a world where life expectancy in 2007 often mirrors an improved quality of life compared to 1952."

p <- p +
  labs(
    title = "LIFE EXPECTANCY",
    subtitle = long_subtitle
  ) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "kanit")) +
  theme(
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(size = 10, margin = margin(0, 0, 5, 0))
  )

p
```

### axes

For our specific goal, we start by removing the axis titles as well as unnecessary space beyond the limits of each axis. Furthermore, there should be no axis line for the y-axis and a relatively thick black line with grey ticks for the x-axis. More details on axis formatting can be found [here](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/summaryarticles/ggplot2intro.html#axes).

```{r}
p <- p +
  scale_y_discrete(
    name = NULL, # remove title
    expand = c(0,0) # no extra space above or below
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL, # remove title
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)) # only 5% extra space above upper limit
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.line.y = element_blank(), # remove line on y-axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = "#AAAAAA"), # x-axis label color
    axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "#AAAAAA", linewidth = 0.4), # x-axis tick color & width
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(4, "pt"), # x-axis tick length
    axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black", linewidth = 0.6) # x-axis line color & width
  )

p
```

### legend

Our legend is supposed to be above the plot and left-aligned. We partly achieve this via `legend.position`, `legend.box.just` and `legend.justification`, but unfortunately this does not fully achieve the goal. We want to have a legend that is left-aligned with respect to the entire plot, not to the y-axis. As far as I know and unlike `plot.title.position = "plot"` which we used above, there is no way of achieving this normally. Thus, we here use a hack by setting the left `margin()` of the legend to a negative value that looks good enough.

Besides the position, the legend title is made bold via `legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")` and we force all elements of the legend to be in one row via `guide_legend(title.position = "left", nrow = 1)`. Finally, the size of the colored squares in the legend is reduced via `legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm")`.

```{r}
p <- p +
  guides(
    fill = guide_legend(
      title.position = "left",
      nrow = 1)
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.box.just = "left",
    legend.justification = "left",
    legend.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, -57, unit = "pt"),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm")
  )

p
```

### grid lines

Lastly, we could adjust the grid lines. By default, ggplot has major and minor grid lines for both axes. Yet, we only want thin, dotted, grey lines for the major grid of the x-axis:

```{r}
p <- p +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = "dotted", color = "#AAAAAA", linewidth = 0.3)
  )

p
```

## improve the plot

We have now mostly reproduced the layout of the *Nature* plot and applied it to our plot. At this point, we could try out things that may improve the plot.

### labels

In certain cases it can be beneficial to additionally label data points. In this plot, we may simply label each bar with rounded life expectancy it represents. We here do so via `geom_text()` where `aes(label = round(lifeExp))`. Note that we also need to add `group = fct_rev(year)` here. This is because so far we applied `fill = fct_rev(year)` in the general `aes()` which led to different groups due to the different fill colors so that `geom_col(position = position_dodge())` knew which groups/bars were supposed to be dodged. However, our labels created via `geom_text()` do not have a fill attribute but should still be dodged per year in the same way. Hence, `group = fct_rev(year)` is required and moreover, `position_dodge(width = 0.9)` actually needs a width value here set to the default dodge width for bars.

Once this is out the way, we make the text white and right-align it with extra space via a value for `hjust` that is larger than 1. Finally, don't forget to apply `family = "kanit"` here as well, as geoms are not part of the `theme()` and thus this `geom_text()` knows nothing about Kanit.

```{r}
p <- p +
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(label = round(lifeExp), group = fct_rev(year)), 
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
    hjust = 1.1,
    color = "white",
    family = "kanit"
  )

p
```

### remove legend

This comes down to personal preferences, but we could remove the legend entirely by instead coloring the subtitle in a way that clarifies what the colors stand for. Here this means that 1952 should be orange and 2007 blue. This is once more made possible via {ggtext} as it allows to use HTML rendering for text in ggplot. This means e.g. that that writing `A <b style='color:red;'> red </b> word` results in "A <b style='color:red;'> red </b> word". Let us therefore rewrite the subtitle accordingly:

```{r}
new_long_subtitle <- "In the mid-twentieth century, global life expectancy was shaped by post-war recovery, with variations across countries. As decades progressed, public health advances and socioeconomic growth painted a new picture of longevity. The data now reflect a world where life expectancy in <b style='color:#37A9E1;'>2007</b> often mirrors an improved quality of life compared to <b style='color:#F7AA59;'>1952</b>."

p <- p +
  labs(
    title = "LIFE EXPECTANCY",
    subtitle = new_long_subtitle
  ) +
  guides(fill = "none") 
  # Be aware that we don't need to this here because we already
  # did so earlier to have automatic line breaks, but without
  # formatting the subtitle as a ggtext element, it would
  # not understand the html commnand:
  # theme(plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_textbox_simple())

p
```

### dumbbell plot

When it comes to visualizing changes or differences between two data points (like life expectancy across two different years in our case), dumbbell plots can offer a clearer and more direct comparison than grouped bar plots. While grouped bar plots efficiently display the individual values, dumbbell plots excel in highlighting the actual change or difference between these values. They connect the two data points with a line, making it visually immediate to see the extent of change. This is particularly beneficial in cases where the focus of the analysis is on the change itself rather than the absolute values. Moreover, dumbbell plots reduce clutter and can be easier to read when dealing with a large number of categories. By using different colors for the points and a subtle line to connect them, dumbbell plots provide a balanced emphasis on both the individual data points and their relative change, thereby offering a more nuanced view of the data. This makes them an excellent choice for our comparison of life expectancies over time.

To create such a dumbbell plot, we need a transformed, wide version of our data (more on long/wide format [here](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#longwide-format)):

```{r}
dat_lifeExp_wide <- dat %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp, names_prefix = 'year_')

dat_lifeExp_wide
```

Furthermore, we need most of what we did so far again with our ggplot object `p` again, but we do need to make some changes, which is why it makes sense to recreate `p2` from scratch. All the theme elements will stay the same for now, so let's wrap them in our own custom theme:

```{r}
theme_nature <- function(base_size = 12) {
  theme_minimal(base_size = base_size) +
    theme(
      text = element_text(family = "kanit"),
      plot.title.position = "plot",
      plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(size = 10, margin = margin(0, 0, 10, 0)),
      axis.line.y = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x = element_text(color = "#AAAAAA"),
      axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "#AAAAAA", linewidth = 0.4),
      axis.ticks.length.x = unit(4, "pt"),
      axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black", linewidth = 0.6),
      legend.position = "top",
      legend.box.just = "left",
      legend.justification = "left",
      legend.margin = margin(0, 0, 0,-57, unit = "pt"),
      legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
      legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major.x = element_line(
        linetype = "dotted",
        color = "#AAAAAA",
        linewidth = 0.3
      )
    )
}
```

Thus, when using our newly created `theme_nature()`, we can focus on the changes in the other parts of our ggplot we made even before adding any new geoms:

 * in the general `aes()` we use `color = fct_rev(year)` instead of `fill = fct_rev(year)`
 * accordingly, we also use `scale_color_manual()` instead of `scale_fill_manual()`
 * Above, we turned off the legend in a later step via `guides(fill = "none")`. This time, we immediately set `guide = "none"` within `scale_color_manual()`.
 * we actually do want extra space beyond the limits for both axes so we remove the `expand =` statements
 * we no longer need bars created via `geom_col()` 
 * we no longer the labels created via `geom_text()`
 
Given this, we have a well-prepared ggplot in need of geoms:

```{r}
p2_base <- ggplot(data = dat) +
  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, color = fct_rev(year)) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Year",
    limits = c("1952", "2007"), 
    values = year_colors, 
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    name = NULL,
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL,
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "LIFE EXPECTANCY",
    subtitle = new_long_subtitle
  ) +
  theme_nature()

p2_base
```

We only need two geoms to create a dumbbell plot here: [`geom_segment()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_segment.html) draws a straight line between points (`x`, `y`) and (`xend`, `yend`), which works nicely with the `dat_lifeExp_wide` created above. Note that the `color = "#AAAAAA"` overrides the `color = fct_rev(year)` from the general `aes()` that would otherwise apply. The points are automatically created and colored via `geom_point()` based on `dat` and the general `aes()`. 

```{r}
p2 <- p2_base +
  geom_segment(
    data = dat_lifeExp_wide,
    aes(x = year_1952, xend = year_2007, y = country, yend = country),
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 3)

p2
```

### labels again

Once again we can decide additionally have data points labeled with their values. We can easily add the rounded life expectancy above each point by basically using the same general aesthetics as `geom_point()` but vertically justifying a bit upwards.

Yet, even more informative is the actual difference between 2007 and 1952. For that, we can use `dat_lifeExp_wide` again where we already have one column per year and can subtract them into a new column `diff`. For easier readability we then format that result by first rounding it and then making it into a string `diff_lab` that always displays "+" or "-" in front of the respective number. I want to position this label on the right side of each dumbbell and could easily do so if the life expectancy were always higher for 2007 but this is not the case for Zimbabwe. Thus, I am also creating a helper column `max_x` which is simply the maximum life expectancy of the two years or in other words the right side of the dumbbell. We now have everything we need to use a second `geom_text` where we use `dat = dat_lifeExp_wide` instead of the dataset provided in `ggplot(data = dat)` and set the aesthetics as `aes(x = max_x, label = diff_lab)`. So far, our labels would be on top of the point of the right side of the dumbbell. Thus, we add `position = position_nudge(x = 1)` to nudge the position for the label one year to the right and additionally use `hjust = 0` so that the label is not centered but instead left-aligned to that nudged position.

```{r}
dat_lifeExp_wide <- dat_lifeExp_wide %>% 
  mutate(
    max_x = pmax(year_2007, year_1952),
    diff = year_2007 - year_1952,
    diff_lab = sprintf("%+d", round(diff))
  )

p2 <- p2 +
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(label = round(lifeExp)),
    size = 2.5,
    vjust = -1,
    family = "kanit"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = dat_lifeExp_wide,
    mapping = aes(x = max_x, label = diff_lab),
    size = 2.5,
    hjust = 0,
    position = position_nudge(x = 1),
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    family = "kanit"
  )

p2
```

# Part 2: Multiple plots

Let us take a step back and look at our data again to realize that we also have information about population and GDP per capita for each country in each year:

```{r}
dat
```

Thus, we could simply create the same ggplot three times: once for each variable. While this is certainly an option and call for packages such as [{patchwork}](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) or [{cowplot}](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html), we can also achieve our goal via facets within the same ggplot.

## data prep

To do that, we need to restructure our data so that all values are in the same column:

```{r}
dat_long <- dat %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap),
    names_to = "statistic",
    values_to = "value"
  )

dat_long
```

Moreover, we need a `dat_all_wide` instead of the `dat_lifeExp_wide` from above:

```{r}
dat_all_wide <- dat_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = value, names_prefix = 'year_') %>% 
    mutate(
    max_x = pmax(year_2007, year_1952),
    diff = year_2007 - year_1952,
    diff_lab = sprintf("%+d", round(diff))
  )
```

Finally, besides changing title and subtitle, the most important change is to add `facet_wrap(facets = ~ statistic, scales = "free_x")` so that we get one plot per value in the `statistic` column while their x-axes are allowed to have different scales:

## facets

```{r}
another_long_subtitle <- paste0("In <b style='color:", year_colors[["2007"]], ";'>2007</b>, compared to <b style='color:", year_colors[["1952"]],";'>1952</b>, life expectancy, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and population data collectively reflect significant advancements in health, economic prosperity, and demographic trends, illustrating an overall enhanced quality of life.")

ggplot(data = dat_long) +
  aes(x = value, y = country, color = fct_rev(year)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ statistic, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Year",
    limits = c("1952", "2007"), 
    values = year_colors,
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP, LIFE EXPECTANCY & POPULATION",
    subtitle = another_long_subtitle
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    name = NULL,
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL,
  ) +
  theme_nature() +
  geom_segment(
    data = dat_all_wide,
    aes(x = year_1952, xend = year_2007, y = country, yend = country),
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(label = round(value)),
    size = 2.5,
    vjust = -1,
    family = "kanit"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = dat_all_wide,
    mapping = aes(x = max_x, label = diff_lab),
    size = 2.5,
    hjust = 0,
    position = position_nudge(x = 1),
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    family = "kanit"
  )
```

## individual labels

So technically this worked, but it obviously needs some tweaking. First, the facets should have nicer labels than just the variable names. Moreover, while it is helpful that the x-axes of the different facets were allowed to have different scales/limits, the vast difference between magnitude of the three variables leads to problematic labels for both the axes and inside the plot. As a result, simply rounding the numbers is still appropriate for life expectancy, but not for the other two. We therefore create a new column `value_lab` in which labels for each point are defined depending on what statistic it is. A convenient way to create such formatted numbers is the `scales::number()` function. Besides `value_lab` in `dat_long`, we also recreate `diff_lab` in `dat_all_wide` this way, additionally adding the +/-. Finally note that also the method of positioning the label on the right side of the dumbbell no longer works. One way of fixing it is also creating a new column `x_pos_lab` which adds a certain value to `max_x` depending on the statistic.

```{r}
dat_long <- dat_long %>% 
  mutate(value_lab = case_when(
    statistic == "lifeExp"   ~ number(value, accuracy = 1),
    statistic == "pop"       ~ number(value, accuracy = 1,   scale = 1/1000000, suffix = "m"),
    statistic == "gdpPercap" ~ number(value, accuracy = 0.1, scale = 1/1000,    suffix = "k")
  ))

dat_all_wide <- dat_all_wide %>%
  mutate(
    diff_lab = case_when(
      statistic == "lifeExp"   ~ number(
        diff,
        style_positive = "plus",
        style_negative = "minus",
        accuracy = 1
      ),
      statistic == "pop"       ~ number(
        diff,
        style_positive = "plus",
        style_negative = "minus",
        accuracy = 1,
        scale = 1 / 1000000,
        suffix = "m"
      ),
      statistic == "gdpPercap" ~ number(
        diff,
        style_positive = "plus",
        style_negative = "minus",
        accuracy = 0.1,
        scale = 1 / 1000,
        suffix = "k"
      )
    ),
    x_pos_lab = case_when(
      statistic == "lifeExp"   ~ max_x + 3,
      statistic == "pop"       ~ max_x + 10000000,
      statistic == "gdpPercap" ~ max_x + 3000
    )
  )
```

We can then apply these new labels to our faceted ggplot. We also provide labels per facet via `labeller = labeller(statistic = ...)`. Finally note that even though we shortened the labels, they will still overlap in some cases where the points are too close to each other. One solution is to have the 1952-label below and the 2007-label above the point which can be achived by moving the `vjust` inside the `aes()` and having it depend on the year via `vjust = if_else(year == "1952", 2, -1)`:

```{r}
facet_labels <- c(lifeExp = "Life Expectancy [years]", pop = "Population", gdpPercap = "GDP per Capita [$]")

p3 <- ggplot(data = dat_long) +
  aes(x = value, y = country, color = fct_rev(year)) +
  facet_wrap(
    facets = ~ statistic,
    scales = "free_x",
    labeller = labeller(statistic = facet_labels)
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Year",
    limits = c("1952", "2007"), 
    values = year_colors,
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(
    name = NULL,
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = NULL,
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "GDP, LIFE EXPECTANCY & POPULATION",
    subtitle = another_long_subtitle
  ) +
  theme_nature() +
  theme(
    panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines"),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "black")
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = dat_all_wide,
    aes(x = year_1952, xend = year_2007, y = country, yend = country),
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(label = value_lab, vjust = if_else(year == "1952", 2, -1)),
    size = 2.5,
    family = "kanit"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = dat_all_wide,
    mapping = aes(x = x_pos_lab, label = diff_lab),
    size = 2.5,
    hjust = 0,
    color = "#AAAAAA",
    family = "kanit"
  )

p3
```

## individual scales

However, the axes are still not optimal for two reasons: The axis labels do not look good except for Life Expectancy and the labels inside the plots are sometimes cut off due to the axis limits. Adjusting axes per facet is actually not possible/straightforward via {ggplot2} so we need load [{ggh4x}](https://teunbrand.github.io/ggh4x/index.html) to make use of `facetted_pos_scales`. Note that we can use `labels = scales::number_format()` in basically the same way as we used `scales::number()` above. Moreover, we choose good combinations of `limits` and `expand` to make sure no labels are cut off and finally pick `breaks` via the convenient `scales::breaks_width()` function:

```{r}
p3 <- p3 + facetted_pos_scales(
  x = list(
    statistic == "lifeExp" ~ scale_x_continuous(
      limits = c(35, 90),
      breaks = breaks_width(20),
      labels = number_format(accuracy = 1)
    ),
    statistic == "pop" ~ scale_x_continuous(
      limits = c(0, 150000000),
      expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.2)),
      breaks = breaks_width(50000000),
      labels = number_format(
        accuracy = 1,
        scale = 1 / 1000000,
        suffix = "m"
      )
    ),
    statistic == "gdpPercap" ~ scale_x_continuous(
      limits = c(0, 50000),
      expand = expansion(mult = c(0.075, 0.075)),
      breaks = breaks_width(25000),
      labels = number_format(
        accuracy = 1,
        scale = 1 / 1000,
        suffix = "k"
      )
    )
  )
) + xlab(NULL) # apparently necessary?!

p3
```

 - After first plot: Talk about exporting and then about looking at your plot not in the RStudio preview window. Maybe even introduce {camcorder}
 - Choosing colors / use viridis colors instead
 - Have full code to get final each plot in a single folded chunk
