Here is the tutorial description as displayed on the [website's conference program](https://www.biometrische-gesellschaft.de/en/events/biometric-colloquia/70th-biometrical-colloquium-2024-in-luebeck/conference-program.html):\n\n> **Advanced data visualization in R: (Re)producing professional plots with ggplot2 and the tidyverse**\n>\n> Lecturer: Paul Schmidt (BioMath GmbH, Hamburg)\n> \n> Learning objectives:\n> \n> - Deep dive into ggplot2: Understand the intricacies of ggplot2 for top-tier data visualization\n> - Data manipulation with tidyverse: Utilize packages like dplyr, tidyr, and forcats to shape data optimally for creating graphs\n> - Aestetic fine-tuning: Master the skills of axis formatting, theme detailing, and color selection\n> - Reproducing Exercise: Recreate published plots to understand the application of ggplot2 techniques in real-world scenarios\n> - Exporting excellence: Learn best practices for exporting plots in publication-ready formats\n> \n> Target group:\n> \n> - Anyone wanting to produce or present high-quality plots. Conveying complex data insights through refinde visualizations is a relevant part of statistical analysis\n> \n> Prerequisites:\n> \n> - Basic understanding of R programming is required\n> - Basci knowledge of ggplot2 and the tidyverse is beneficial, but not required\n> - R-packages: tidyverse, cowplot, ggrepel, ggtext, viridis\n> \n> Format: Hybrid\n\n# Part 0: Setup\n\nThe decision on which plots to create in this workshop was inspired by [this blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/15_alternative_paired_bars/15_alternative_paired_bars.html) by [Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/) whose R and data visualization content is worth checking out!\n\nYou will need to install and load the following packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggrepel\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggtext\")\ninstall.packages(\"scales\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"viridis\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(viridis)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that we expect participants with different levels of experience in this tutorial. Furthermore, the tutorial duration is only 3 hours and thus quite short. As a consequence, this material often links to other resources with more detailed information instead of blowing up the content of this material. However, where possible, these links don't simply lead to official online documentation etc. which may be hard to grasp for beginners, but instead to other workshop content created by this tutorial's main lecturer.\n\n# Part 1: A single plot\n\nLets us first create a single plot to compare the life expectancy between 1952 and 2007 for seven countries, respectively. The data is courtesy of [the Gapminder foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/) and can easily be accessed via the [{gapminder}](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/) package. We can then make use of [the pipe operator `%>%`](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#the-pipe-operator) to create a subset of the data via the [`filter()` function](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#filter). Finally, in order for our ggplot to work as intended in the next step, we also need to format the year column as a factor instead of an integer value via [`mutate()`](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/rbasics/tidyverse.html#mutate). Both functions are from the [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package which we loaded as part of the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- gapminder::gapminder %>% \n  filter(year == 1952 | year == 2007) %>% \n  filter(country %in% c(\"Canada\", \"Germany\", \"Japan\", \"Netherlands\", \"Nigeria\", \"Vietnam\", \"Zimbabwe\")) %>% \n  mutate(year = as.factor(year))\n\ndat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 14 Ã— 6\n   country     continent year  lifeExp       pop gdpPercap\n   <fct>       <fct>     <fct>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>\n 1 Canada      Americas  1952     68.8  14785584    11367.\n 2 Canada      Americas  2007     80.7  33390141    36319.\n 3 Germany     Europe    1952     67.5  69145952     7144.\n 4 Germany     Europe    2007     79.4  82400996    32170.\n 5 Japan       Asia      1952     63.0  86459025     3217.\n 6 Japan       Asia      2007     82.6 127467972    31656.\n 7 Netherlands Europe    1952     72.1  10381988     8942.\n 8 Netherlands Europe    2007     79.8  16570613    36798.\n 9 Nigeria     Africa    1952     36.3  33119096     1077.\n10 Nigeria     Africa    2007     46.9 135031164     2014.\n11 Vietnam     Asia      1952     40.4  26246839      605.\n12 Vietnam     Asia      2007     74.2  85262356     2442.\n13 Zimbabwe    Africa    1952     48.5   3080907      407.\n14 Zimbabwe    Africa    2007     43.5  12311143      470.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne typical way you may find data like this visualized is via a grouped bar plot. The minimum amount of code to create such a plot via ggplot is this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = dat) +\n  aes(x = lifeExp, y = country, fill = year) +\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1650}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Read this](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/dsfair_quarto/ch/summaryarticles/ggplot2intro.html#lets-start) if you are not familiar with the general ggplot syntax. We need to add `position = position_dodge()` to `geom_col()`, since the default is to stack the multiple bars (for the different years) on top of each other.\n\nTODO\n\n - get data ready\n - create grouped bar plot\n\n## Reproducing a theme\n\nUsing `theme()` allows us to format our plot in any way we want. Instead of picking things based on what feels good, let us here try to recreate the layout of a plot published in [*Nature*](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03305-w) in '150 years of Nature: a data graphic charts our evolution' by Richard Monastersky & Richard Van Noorden (2019).
