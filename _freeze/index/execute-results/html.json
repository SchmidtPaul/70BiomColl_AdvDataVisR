Here is the tutorial description as displayed on the [website's conference program](https://www.biometrische-gesellschaft.de/en/events/biometric-colloquia/70th-biometrical-colloquium-2024-in-luebeck/conference-program.html):\n\n> **Advanced data visualization in R: (Re)producing professional plots with ggplot2 and the tidyverse**\n>\n> Lecturer: Paul Schmidt (BioMath GmbH, Hamburg)\n> \n> Learning objectives:\n> \n> - Deep dive into ggplot2: Understand the intricacies of ggplot2 for top-tier data visualization\n> - Data manipulation with tidyverse: Utilize packages like dplyr, tidyr, and forcats to shape data optimally for creating graphs\n> - Aestetic fine-tuning: Master the skills of axis formatting, theme detailing, and color selection\n> - Reproducing Exercise: Recreate published plots to understand the application of ggplot2 techniques in real-world scenarios\n> - Exporting excellence: Learn best practices for exporting plots in publication-ready formats\n> \n> Target group:\n> \n> - Anyone wanting to produce or present high-quality plots. Conveying complex data insights through refinde visualizations is a relevant part of statistical analysis\n> \n> Prerequisites:\n> \n> - Basic understanding of R programming is required\n> - Basci knowledge of ggplot2 and the tidyverse is beneficial, but not required\n> - R-packages: tidyverse, cowplot, ggrepel, ggtext, viridis\n> \n> Format: Hybrid\n\n# Part 0: Setup\n\nYou will need to install the following packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggrepel\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggtext\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"virids\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Part 1: A single plot\n\nTODO\n\n# Part 2: Multiple plots\n\nTODO",
