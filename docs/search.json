Here is the tutorial description as displayed on the websiteâ€™s conference program:\n\nAdvanced data visualization in R: (Re)producing professional plots with ggplot2 and the tidyverse\nLecturer: Paul Schmidt (BioMath GmbH, Hamburg)\nLearning objectives:\n\nDeep dive into ggplot2: Understand the intricacies of ggplot2 for top-tier data visualization\nData manipulation with tidyverse: Utilize packages like dplyr, tidyr, and forcats to shape data optimally for creating graphs\nAestetic fine-tuning: Master the skills of axis formatting, theme detailing, and color selection\nReproducing Exercise: Recreate published plots to understand the application of ggplot2 techniques in real-world scenarios\nExporting excellence: Learn best practices for exporting plots in publication-ready formats\n\nTarget group:\n\nAnyone wanting to produce or present high-quality plots. Conveying complex data insights through refinde visualizations is a relevant part of statistical analysis\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nBasic understanding of R programming is required\nBasci knowledge of ggplot2 and the tidyverse is beneficial, but not required\nR-packages: tidyverse, cowplot, ggrepel, ggtext, viridis\n\nFormat: Hybrid\n\n\nPart 0: Setup\nYou will need to install the following packages\n\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"gapminder\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggrepel\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggtext\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"virids\")\n\n\n\nPart 1: A single plot\n\n\nPart 2: Multiple plots"
